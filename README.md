## Features:

* (auto-)import ratings using keywords in comment tags of files
* Export rated tracks to playlist files (e.g. for import in other apps)
* Display ratings in track context menu or on older devices using the *Music Information Screen* plugin
* Skip tracks (unrated or rated below spec. rating) using the *CustomSkip* plugin
